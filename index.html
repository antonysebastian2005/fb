   <p>Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça ,
        is a professional football club based in Barcelona,Spain, that competes in La Liga,
        the top flight of Spanish football.Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss,Spanish, 
        German and English footballers led by Joan Gamper,the club has become a symbol 
        of Catalan culture and Catalanism,hence the motto 
        "Més que un club" ("More than a club").The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça",
         written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[4] Barcelona traditionally play in 
         dark shades of blue and red stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.</p>
         <h2>1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War</h2>

         <p>On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, 
             the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was 
             closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.
             [29] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, 
             the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, 
             to operate a professional football club</p>

<h2>Crest and Kits</h2>

<p>n 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. 
    The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. 
    Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. 
    The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, 
    and the team colours at the bottom.</p>
    <p>he blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.
         Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt.
          The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours 
          were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author 
          Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. 
          In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper 
          and are those of his home team</p>
